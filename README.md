# FindingSilence
Program finds sound within an uploaded audio file containing sounds and silence based on the sum of all frequencies in a soundbite. It is meant to be used alongside sound sprites to separate an audio file into individual sounds that can be played separately from one file. The frequency cutoff can be adjusted using the slider labeled "Sensitivity". Currently, it is not that accurate.
